    <h1>Jake Howard's Biography</h1>

    <p>
        My name is Jake Howard, I’m an Information Management and Technology Major as well as an Army ROTC Cadet interested in doing Cyber Security for the United States Army. I have earned a spot on the Dean's list every semester I’ve been a student at Syracuse University.

    <h2>Personal Information</h2>

    <p>
        I grew up in Lake George, New York; so naturally, When i'm taking a break from being a full time student, I love spending time on the <strong>water.</strong> I really enjoy fishing, tubing, wakeboarding, and swimming. I even work as a dockhand on Lake George. I find being in the outdoors really relaxing.

        During my junior year of highschool, I visited Syracuse University. Fortunately, my dad and I sat in on an I-School presentation and I fell in love with the idea of technology being my future. Since I got to Syracuse University, I've been really interested in doing Cyber Security. Overall, I'm eager to learn.
