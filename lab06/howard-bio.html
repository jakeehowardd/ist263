    My name is Jake Howard, I’m an Information Management and Technology Major as well as an Army ROTC Cadet interested in doing Cyber Security for the United States Army. I have earned a spot on the Dean's list every semester I’ve been a student at Syracuse University. Outside of work life, I enjoy fishing and playing lacrosse for the Men's Syracuse Club team.
